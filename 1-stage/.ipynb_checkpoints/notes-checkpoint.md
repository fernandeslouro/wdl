**churn_usersprofile**: Socio-demographic characterization and the residence area of the bus users. Information like the gender, age class, county of origin of bus users can be very useful for this challenge.  
**churn_od**: Demand for public transportation in each county of origin and its respective parish of destination.  

**Goals**: Create a framework that will allow to measure the increase and decrease the passengers of public transport towards cities that are more inclusive and sustainable.  
**Outcome**: Given the public transports usersâ€™ profile in two periods, the aggregated OD matrix, and any other external or derived data, this exercise should produce the following major outcomes: Identify churn profiles and drivers, propose measures to win back lost segments and their expected impact.
